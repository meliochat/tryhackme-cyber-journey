## 🔍 Summary
Explains the concept of the Pyramid of Pain, a model that ranks different indicators of compromise (IOCs) by how difficult they are for attackers to change.

## 💡 What I learned
- Understanding of indicators like hashes, IPs, domain names, and tools
- Why attacking TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) is more effective
- Threat hunting strategies using the pyramid

## 🧠 Notes
Good theoretical foundation for anyone interested in threat intelligence and detection strategies.
